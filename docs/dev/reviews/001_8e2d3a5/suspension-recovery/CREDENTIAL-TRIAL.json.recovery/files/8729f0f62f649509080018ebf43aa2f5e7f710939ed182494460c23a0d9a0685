# Backend object lifecycle and review boundaries

Apply these shared invariants to PLAN/TASKS generation, bounded implementation, hosted reconciliation and interruption recovery. Local governing documents and verified Git/check evidence are authoritative; backend objects are projections. Hosting is optional. sdd-manage coordinates transitions; sdd-implement executes tasks and persists results; sdd-forge owns provider writes.

## Phase activation

Keep the complete intended hierarchy in local PLAN/TASKS. Create a phase's label, all its milestones and all its task issues only after its predecessor is complete and before its first task executes. First-phase activation has no predecessor. Completion includes the predecessor's reviews, required reports, all milestone closures when tracking is active, local exits and required target integration/publication. Starting the next phase also requires authorization within the selected range.

Preparation does not activate a phase. Projection reads the complete hierarchy to resolve identity/dependencies but writes only the eligible phase. Added work in an already active phase is projected before execution. Future-phase work remains unprojected, including feature deltas. When tracking is enabled, incomplete or unverified phase projection blocks the first task unless the human explicitly authorizes local-only continuation. Preserve existing future-phase objects as historical/pre-existing state; report them rather than deleting them to enforce timing retrospectively.

## Explicit review units

Each phase has one or more delivery milestones followed by a dedicated phase review milestone containing exactly one phase code review/testing/report task. Each delivery milestone ends with its own milestone code review/testing/report task, including the last delivery milestone. The final phase review milestone has no additional milestone review task.

PLAN owns these milestones and exits; sdd-tasks derives executable review tasks with stable IDs, prerequisites, scope and evidence. Review tasks count toward selected next-N ranges. The phase review depends on all **delivery** milestones being complete/closed, not its own still-open milestone. Accepted existing hierarchies require a scoped amendment; never insert or renumber tasks implicitly during execution.

## Completion ordering

1. Verify task acceptance, tests and documentation; reconcile its owning checklist/evidence; commit result and status together, push and verify containment. Then close its task issue with evidence when tracking is active. A task issue records work on its working branch; target integration is separate.
2. Execute a delivery milestone's final review task after preceding delivery tasks complete. Review the whole capability and relevant dependencies, test applicable exits/regressions, fix blockers and commit/push its report. Close this review task's issue like any other task.
3. Close/read back the delivery milestone only after every constituent issue, including the review issue, is closed and its review/report/exit evidence is established. Unexpected open or foreign issues and ambiguous ownership block closure; never close foreign issues to clear the gate.
4. After all delivery milestones close, execute the phase review task: review cross-milestone interactions, phase exits and remaining findings, run required checks, repair blockers, commit/push the phase report and close its issue. Then close/read back the final review milestone.
5. Reconcile local parent claims, verify the full phase and perform required explicit integration, merged-state verification and publication before activating an authorized next phase. A partial range pushes and pauses without inventing additional review work beyond its selected tasks.

Local-only execution applies the same review/report/exit gates without hosted closure. If an enabled backend cannot complete closure, keep local verified results and report hosted reconciliation pending; dependent phase review/advancement remains blocked. Independent tasks in an already activated phase may continue within scope when dependencies permit. A phase label has no close state on GitHub: retain its historical associations. Unsupported backend state transitions need an explicit backend procedure, not deletion or an invented equivalent.

## Review, repairs and deferral

sdd-verify owns read-only implementation code review and check evidence for milestone/phase boundaries, with focused specialists routed by sdd-manage as needed. sdd-implement owns repairs and completion; sdd-tdd designs/changes tests; sdd-docs maintains documentation; sdd-report presents evidence. Code review and testing are separate obligations. Passing tests without code review cannot complete a review task.

Fix bugs, critical code issues and every SPEC/PLAN violation before completing a review task. Missing or failing required evidence blocks completion. Route governing-contract or out-of-scope changes to their owner; do not disguise them as deferrable findings. Only non-critical code issues consistent with SPEC/PLAN may be postponed.

Keep required repairs and findings whose deferral eligibility is unestablished in Findings/Blockers, outside the deferred TODO section. Each report has a TODO section (`None` when empty). A deferred finding has a stable ID, location/evidence, impact/severity, deferral rationale showing contracts/exits remain satisfied, proposed solution options/tradeoffs and follow-up owner/scope. Phase reports carry unresolved milestone findings and add phase findings. The final implementation report aggregates unresolved/deferred milestone and phase TODOs without losing options or provenance; preserve resolution references for earlier findings. The last phase review task includes the final report when the full task list completes. Partial requests cannot claim full-project completion.

## Report locations

| Workflow / artifact | Path or prefix |
| --- | --- |
| Main/greenfield phase report | `docs/dev/reports/phases/<phase-id>/PHASE-REPORT.md` |
| Main/greenfield milestone report | `docs/dev/reports/phases/<phase-id>/<milestone-id>.md` |
| Main/greenfield final report | `docs/dev/reports/IMPLEMENTATION-REPORT.md` |
| Phase-checkpoint steering revision records | `docs/dev/reports/phases/<phase-id>/revisions/<revision-id>/` |
| Feature reports and records | `docs/dev/features/<feature-id>/` |

Use filesystem-safe stable IDs; link reports from owning review tasks. Steering retains applicable review/revision stage basenames including `REVISION-REPORT.md` within its phase-specific prefix, instead of the general reviews directory. General campaigns retain [review campaign](review-campaigns.md) storage. Feature milestone/phase reports remain under their feature prefix; qualify paths by phase ID when multiple phases would collide, and place the feature's final `IMPLEMENTATION-REPORT.md` at that prefix. Feature archive eligibility is separate from report placement. Preserve established historical paths unless an authorized migration includes them.

## Recovery and changed scope

On resume, inspect actual lists, reports, Git commits/pushes and hosted states. Finish the earliest unmet authorized transition, including older pending closures. Reuse exact managed identities after partial creation. For an uncertain issue/milestone write, read actual state and evidence before replay; incomplete or contradictory lookup leaves the outcome unknown. A report partly written needs missing review/check/repair work; a committed report needs its pending push, not repeated review. A closed milestone with uncommitted local parent status needs status reconciliation. A completed phase review with integration pending needs that existing integration finished before next-phase activation. Do not introduce a second progress registry or require a report to contain its own commit SHA.

Accepted steering/feature changes can invalidate task and parent acceptance. Preserve stable IDs, earlier reports and evidence; mark reassessment pending and reconcile authorized issue/milestone reopening when current acceptance fails. Retired work is not verified completion and must not be silently closed as completed. Feature transfer retains its original issue; a scoped feature parent cannot close a whole-project milestone while another owning list still contains unfinished work. Existing completed phases require a scoped accepted amendment and dependency reassessment, not silent replay or advancement.
