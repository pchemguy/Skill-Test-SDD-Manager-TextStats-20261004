# Workflow identity, branches, and artifact locations

Apply these provider-neutral defaults when naming workflow branches or associating them with retained documents. **sdd-manage**'s **Branch management** procedure performs allocation and Git setup; **sdd-integrate-feature** owns incorporation/archive eligibility. This convention grants no mutation or hosting authority.

## Naming

| Workflow | Branch | Associated documents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Revision | `revision/<campaign>-<slug>` | `docs/dev/reviews/<campaign>/` |
| Steering | `revision/<campaign>-<slug>` | `docs/dev/reports/phases/<phase-id>/revisions/<campaign>/`; a minimal revision record is sufficient. |
| Feature | `feature/<campaign>-<slug>` | `docs/dev/features/<campaign>/` for package identity/navigation and completed incorporated sources. |
| Main phase | `phase/<phase-number>-<slug>` | Main governing documents and owning TASKS remain in `docs/dev/`. |

A campaign is `<sequence>_<baseline-sha>`, for example `007_df531c2`; revision/feature branch identity must exactly match its directory. Use the phase number/name from accepted PLAN/TASKS, not a campaign counter. The main integration branch is established explicitly; a workflow name never selects Git's default branch.

## Identity and collisions

- **Allocate once:** Inspect `docs/dev/reviews/`, `docs/dev/features/` and `docs/dev/reports/phases/*/revisions/` plus relevant published records/refs. Use one greater than the highest allocated/reserved repository-wide positive sequence, padded to at least three digits across reviews, features and phase-nested revisions; do not fill historical gaps or reuse an ID. Reserve identity at the first record/branch preparation; resolve concurrent allocation conflicts before publication, without renumbering established records.
- **Pin baseline:** Use the campaign's starting commit, at least seven uniquely resolving hexadecimal characters, and record its full SHA in retained context. Keep branch/directory identity stable as HEAD advances, including review-to-revision continuation.
- **Slug:** Use concise lowercase ASCII words separated by hyphens. Validate the full name with `git check-ref-format --branch`. If occupied by unrelated work, keep identity and choose a distinct descriptive suffix; never reuse a branch from its name alone.
- **Overrides:** Respect explicit project/user naming and location policy; record its equivalent identity/target association. Preserve suitable legacy/in-flight branches and historical directories on continuation; never rename or delete them automatically. An occupied old phase branch needs a verified matching continuation or a distinct slug.
- **Context:** Retain workflow, campaign or phase ID, full baseline, actual working/target branch and destinations, authoritative sources, and scope in existing campaign/task/change evidence. No separate branch registry is required.

## Artifact lifecycle

Review/revision artifacts use the **Review campaigns** convention. Lightweight steering allocates the same global identity under `docs/dev/reports/phases/<phase-id>/revisions/<campaign>/` and can use a concise REVISION-REPORT recording objective, scope, baseline, paused target, verification, and publication, without a fabricated review or plan.

Feature preparation creates a small package identity/navigation record, `docs/dev/features/<campaign>/README.md`, referencing the active root FEATURE documents and branch context. Active FEATURE sources keep their established paths in docs/dev; isolated branches/worktrees may carry separate packages, but one worktree must not overwrite an unrelated active package. This record supplies navigation, not a second workflow state store.

After complete accepted feature incorporation and task/evidence disposition, retain eligible feature sources under that directory with their basenames. Update links and mark archived sources historical: main documents/TASKS own current state, and archived checkboxes are not executable task owners. Partial incorporation retains still-needed active sources. The feature owner verifies archive eligibility on the feature branch before final integration; naming alone proves neither incorporation nor completion.
